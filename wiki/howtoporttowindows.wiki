= Introduction =

The windows port is not available , to do that someone need to implement Windows Webcam capture for Java and send it to me.


= Details =

Sun Java have webcam support with JMF. But it doesn't work with MacOS X, and i don't have windows OS :-/

It possible to add windows support simply by adding this kind of java file.

== Sample Windows support ==
package fr.sokaris.faceme.webcam;

import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;

public class {os.name string without spaces}Capture implements Capture {
	public void start() throws WebCamException {
        }

	public void stop() {
        }

	public BufferedImage showSource() throws WebCamException {
          return null;
        }
	
	public int getWidth() {
          return 0;
        }
	
	public int getHeight() {
          return 0;
        }
}
